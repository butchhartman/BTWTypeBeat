// TODO: Currently, this chunk works rather spectacularly but has major
// performance problems. I need to figure out how to draw many chunks with low
// performance impact. (Backface culling, instancing, greedy meshing/not drawing
// unseen blocks)

// Right now I'm getting ~160 FPS rendering a single 16x16x16 chunk

// When backface culling is enabled, I get still ~160 FPS rendering a single
// 16x16x16 chunk. It is a more stable framerate, however.

// By simply not drawing unsee-able blocks, my framerate rises to ~430 rendering the single 16X16x16 chunk.

// What I'm doing here is not looking good in terms of actually working. I think I need to read up on voxel engines and how they work.
